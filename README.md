# Loan-Credit-Risk-Prediction
This case study is based on a very famous dataset in Machine Learning "The German Credit Risk dataset".

The goal is to predict if this loan credit would be a risk to the bank or not

In simple terms, if the loan amount is given to the applicant, will they pay back or become a defaulter?

Since there are many applications which needs to be processed everyday, it will be helpful if there was a predictive model in place which can assist the executives to do their job by giving them a heads up about approval or rejection of a new loan application.

In this case study I will discuss the step by step approach to create a Machine Learning predictive model.
